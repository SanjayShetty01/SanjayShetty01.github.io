            <p>
                Hey there! I'm a tech enthusiast with a knack for languages like R, 
                Python, Bash, and Scala. I love diving into complex problems and making 
                code work like magic. You'll often find me in the AWS cloud, ensuring that 
                everything runs smoothly and scales seamlessly - it's my way of bringing 
                robust solutions to life.

            <p>
                But, let's not get too caught up in the tech talk! Off the screen, I'm a huge 
                racing fan, especially when it comes to F1, WEC and Formula E. 
                Curiosity fuels my journey, and I approach challenges with a determination to find 
                innovative solutions.
