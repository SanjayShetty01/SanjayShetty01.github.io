            <p>
                Passionate about crafting effective solutions, 
                I'm an R Shiny Developer experienced in creating and 
                maintaining applications for Pharma Analytics. 
                Skilled in managing GitHub repositories and enhancing 
                UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
                I thrive on optimizing R code for efficiency. 
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Beyond R Shiny, I've embraced React and Flask, 
                collaborating on an AWS-supported project for seamless deployment. 
                My role also involves integrating AWS services with React and Flask 
                while designing and creating infrastructure in AWS for streamlined development.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I'm not at work or in denial about having a social life, 
                I'm home watching F1 and WEC archives 
                (The most played video being Kimi Räikkönen's 2005 Monaco Grand Prix Race), 
                [Old] Top Gear, Grand Tour and reading economic and financial reports. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Deep down, I'm just a curious, consistent, persistent person. 
                An ideal quality if you plan on using Arch. (I use Arch, BTW XD)
