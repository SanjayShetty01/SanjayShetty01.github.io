              <em><strong>NOAA Earthquake R Package</strong></em>
            </p>
            
              <p>
                The project aims to create an R package tailored for working with earthquake 
                data from the NOAA Significant Earthquake Database. It provides functions for 
                data retrieval, cleaning, and visualization, facilitating earthquake analysis 
                and research.

                  Features:

                    Data Retrieval: Easily access earthquake data from the NOAA database.
                    Data Cleaning: Streamline the process of cleaning and preparing earthquake data for analysis.
                    Visualization: Visualize earthquake locations and patterns using built-in tools.
                    GitHub Deployment: Access the package on GitHub for collaboration and updates.
                    Testing: The package has passed rigorous R-CMD-Check and Travis CI build tests, ensuring reliability.

                  Capstone Project:

                    This project was completed as part of the 'Mastering Software Development 
                    with R Specialization',

              <em><strong>Predicting Opening Price of NIFTY50</strong></em>
            </p>
              <p>
                The project focuses on predicting the opening price of the NIFTY-50 using 
                sentiment analysis alongside data from other major indices. We employed 
                various machine learning and neural network algorithms to develop predictive models.

                Key Components:
                
                    Data Collection: Gathered historical data of the NIFTY-50 and other major indices.
                    Sentiment Analysis: Analyzed sentiment data from relevant sources to incorporate 
                    market sentiment into the predictive models.                
                    Model Development: Employed a range of machine learning and neural network algorithms 
                    to create predictive models based on historical data and sentiment analysis.
                    Model Selection: Identified the best-performing model through rigorous evaluation and 
                    validation processes.
                    AWS Lambda Deployment: Deployed the selected model on AWS Lambda for automated execution.                
                    Cronjob Setup: Established a cronjob in EventBridge to trigger the model automatically 
                    at specified intervals.
                    Output Management: The predictions generated by the deployed model are updated and stored 
                    in a CSV file located in an AWS S3 bucket for easy access and analysis.
